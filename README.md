# $${\color{orange} \textbf{Introduction To Devops}}$$

## Project
- A project is like taking on a task that has a clear goal, a plan, and a deadline.
- simply getting something done, step by step, to achieve a clear result.
## Project Phases

# $${\color{red} \textbf{ Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)}}$$

- The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to building software, ensuring quality, efficiency, and reliability. 

## 1. Planning
- Define project goals and scope.
- Estimate resources, time, and cost.
- Identify potential risks and solutions.

## 2. Requirement Analysis
- Gather and document user and system requirements.
- Analyze technical and business needs.
- Create a clear specification of deliverables.

## 3. Design
- Create a blueprint for the software architecture.
- Define system components, interfaces, and workflows.
- Ensure design meets functional and non-functional requirements.

## 4. Development
- Write the code based on design specifications.
- Build system components and integrate them.
- Follow coding standards and practices.

## 5. Testing
- Validate the software against requirements.
- Identify and fix bugs or defects.
- Perform various testing types (unit, integration, system, user acceptance).

## 6. Deployment
- Release the software to the production environment.
- Configure systems and ensure smooth rollout.
- Provide user access and training, if required.

## 7. Maintenance
- Monitor software performance.
- Update and enhance features based on user feedback.
- Fix issues and ensure system reliability.

## Waterfall vs Agile

| Aspect               | Waterfall                              | Agile                                   |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Process**          | Step-by-step, one phase at a time.     | Iterative, work in small cycles.       |
| **Flexibility**      | Hard to change once started.           | Easy to adapt to changes.              |
| **Planning**         | All planning is done at the start.     | Plans are updated regularly.           |
| **Delivery**         | Final product delivered at the end.    | Delivered in small parts (sprints).    |
| **User Involvement** | Minimal after requirements are set.    | High, throughout the process.          |
| **Testing**          | Happens after development is done.     | Happens during each cycle.             |
| **Documentation**    | Detailed and extensive.                | Minimal, just the basics.              |
| **Team Structure**   | Teams work separately (e.g., dev, test). | Teams work together (cross-functional).|
| **Best For**         | Fixed, unchanging requirements.        | Changing or evolving requirements.     |


## Devops
- DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops)
- DevOps is all about automating processes, and continuously improving the software development
- and deployment pipeline to deliver products quickly and reliably

# DevOps Tools Overview

This document provides a simple explanation of some essential DevOps tools.

## 1. Git
- A version control tool to track changes in your code.
- Tracks project history and helps you manage versions.
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.

## 2. Docker
-  A tool that packages your app and its dependencies into containers for easy deployment anywhere.
- Containers ensure your app works consistently across different environments.

## 3. Kubernetes (K8s)
-  A platform to manage and scale your containers (e.g., Docker).
- Automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of containerized applications.

## 4. Terraform
-  A tool to manage your cloud infrastructure using code.
- Allows you to define and provision resources like servers, databases, and networks in the cloud.


## 5. Datadog
-  A monitoring tool that collects data on your systems and apps.
- Helps track performance and spot issues before they become critical.

### ${\color{blue} \textbf{Capital Expenditure }}$
- CapEx refers to the money a company invests in assets like buildings, machinery, or equipment that will be used for a long time

### ${\color{blue} \textbf{Operational Expenditure }}$
- This refers to the day-to-day expenses that a company incurs in order to run its business.
- It includes costs like rent, utilities, wages, office supplies, and other expenses necessary for ongoing business operations.



## $${\color{orange} \textbf{Virtualization}}$$
- Dividing physical server into multiple logical machines using software called Hypervisor

**Hypervisor**
- it manages multiple os on single host

1. **Bare Metal** hypervisor directly installed on hardware
2. **Hosted** -> hypervisor installed on host os


### ${\color{red} \textbf{On-Premises} \ \color{green} \ \textbf{vs} \color{orange} \ \textbf{Cloud}}$
- Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access and use computer resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more) over the internet.

#### On-Premises vs. Cloud Infrastructure

| **Aspect**             | **On-Premises**                                                            | **Cloud**                                                                            |
